# Storage

## Hot/Cold Storage

In advanced storage mode, files are managed across two directories:

- **Hot storage**: Where downloads land and in-progress files live (replaces `downloadDir` in advanced mode)
- **Cold storage**: Where finished files are moved for long-term storage

### File movement

- `moveEpisodeToColdStorage()`: Moves a single episode's files (.mkv, .mp4, .ass) from hot → cold. Skips files with .part (in-progress). Uses `fs.rename` with `fs.copyFile` + `fs.unlink` fallback for cross-filesystem moves.
- `moveAllFilesToColdStorage()`: Scans hot dir for all finished files and moves them to cold. Reports progress via `storage:move-to-cold-progress` IPC.

### Auto-move triggers

- If merge disabled: after `onEpisodeComplete` callback
- If merge enabled: after `onMergeComplete` callback
- Manual: "Move all to cold storage" button in Settings > Storage

### File scanning

In advanced mode, `file:check-episodes`, `file:delete-episode`, and `downloaded-anime-delete` check/delete from both hot and cold dirs. Cold storage takes priority when a file exists in both locations. `scanAndMerge` also scans both directories.

## File Layout on Disk

```
{downloadDir}/
  {sanitized anime name}/
    {anime name} - 01 [Author].mp4        raw video (author-tagged)
    {anime name} - 01 [Author].ass        subtitles
    {anime name} - 01 [Author].mkv        merged (video + subs)
    {anime name} - 01 [Author].mp4.part   in-progress download
    {anime name} - 01 [Author2].mkv       another translation
    {anime name} - 01.mkv                 legacy (no author tag)
```

Multiple translations per episode coexist via `[Author]` filename tags.
Legacy filenames (without author tag) are still detected and supported.

Filename sanitization: `[<>:"/\|?*]` replaced with `_`, whitespace normalized.
