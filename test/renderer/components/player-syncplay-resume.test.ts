// The resume-vs-room precedence rule (#240). `resumeFromSavedPosition` is an
// unexported `<script setup>` internal of a ~2.9k-line SFC wired to dozens of
// `window.api` channels and to WebGPU/MSE/JASSUB init, so there is no mount
// harness for it here — this scans the source, the same approach
// `player-toast-slot.test.ts` takes for the toast-slot gate and
// `test/ipc-channels.test.ts` takes for the channel table. The *behavior* the
// guard reads is covered for real at the composable seam, in
// `use-syncplay-client.test.ts` (`hasRemoteStateApplied` + the deferral block).
//
// What makes the scan non-vacuous: each assertion below is keyed to one edit
// that would reintroduce the bug — dropping the guard, moving it after the
// write, letting the toast survive it, or losing the `loadedmetadata` fan-out
// that applies the parked state in the first place.
